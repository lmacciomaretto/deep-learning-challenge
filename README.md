This is the repo for Assignment #21 Deep Learning Challenge


For this part of the assignment, you’ll write a report on the performance of the deep learning model you created for Alphabet Soup.

The report should contain the following:

Overview of the analysis:
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. The purpose of this analysis is to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. The CSV file provided contains data from more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years and captures metadata about each organization, such as:

EIN and NAME—Identification columns
APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
USE_CASE—Use case for funding
ORGANIZATION—Organization type
STATUS—Active status
INCOME_AMT—Income classification
SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application
ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

Results: 

Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
What variable(s) are the features for your model?
What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
