# deep-learning-challenge
This is the repo for Assignment #21 Deep Learning Challenge.

It contains a main folder called Deep_Learning_Training. Inside this folder, there are 3 Jupyter Notebooks:
* AlphabetSoupCharity.ipynb
* AlphabetSoupCharity_Optimization.ipynb
* AlphabetSoupCharity_Auto_Tunning.ipynb

In that order, the code evolves from the first attempt at creating a Neural Network with minimum Data Pre-processing and a basic NN architecture, to an optimized model with more Data exploration and processing and added neurons and layers. Finally, the third notebook contains an auto-tuner aiming to find out what the best model is. In this main folder there is a report file of the model, named Performance_Report and an Images folder with the model report pictures.

A description of the steps taken in this challenge is found in the report file.

The code was written based on class files, appropriate documentation, and with the help of TA Erin Wills.
